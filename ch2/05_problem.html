            Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI),[5] previously known as PUBG
            Mobile India,[6] is a version of PUBG Mobile, available in
            India.[7][8][9][10] It is an online multiplayer battle royale game
            by Krafton.[11] The game was initially released on 2 July 2021 for
            Android devices,[11] and on 18 August 2021 for iOS devices. There
            are two official tournaments in a calendar year in BGMI, held by
            Krafton India Esports. The first is BGMI India Series (BGIS) and the
            later one is BGMI Pro Series (BMPS).

            As of July 2022, BGMI surpassed 200 million downloads on the Google
            Play Store.[12] The game was banned in India on July 28, 2022, by
            the Indian government.[13] According to a statement from Krafton,
            the ban was removed on May 26, 2023.[14]You can download this game by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bgmi+download&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN1119IN1120&oq=bgmi+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDwgBEAAYQxixAxiABBiKBTIGCAAQRRg7Mg8IARAAGEMYsQMYgAQYigUyBwgCEAAYgAQyDwgDEAAYQxixAxiABBiKBTIMCAQQABhDGIAEGIoFMgwIBRAAGEMYgAQYigUyBwgGEAAYgAQyDwgHEAAYQxixAxiABBiKBTIMCAgQABhDGIAEGIoFMgwICRAAGEMYgAQYigXSAQk1ODMxajBqMTWoAgiwAgHxBVu5z3b-lupZ&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">click here </a></p>
